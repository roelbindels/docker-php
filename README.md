# PHP FPM Docker Image
Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/edyan/php

Docker containers to expose PHP FPM with a specific version of PHP (5.3 -> 7.2) installed
with main PHP extensions (curl, pdo, gd, etc ....) as well as XDebug.

It's mainly made for development purposes but can also be used as Production.

The aim of these containers is to be used with docker-compose and especially with
[our Stakkr Stack](https://github.com/edyan/stakkr).

**Why using debian and not the official PHP images ?**
*Because a lot of hosts are based on Debian, so it's to have in development the same environment than in dev*

**Why iptables ?**
*Because [stakkr](https://github.com/edyan/stakkr) blocks SMTP ports to avoid a lot of emails to be send during developments and by mistake*


## Usage
Add the following to your docker-compose.yml file:
```yaml
php:
    image: edyan/php
    environment:
        FPM_UID: 1000
        FPM_GID: 1000
    volumes_from:
        - app
    links:
        - mysql
```

## Environment variables
Two variables have been created (`FPM_UID` and `FPM_GID`) to override the www-data user and group ids.
Giving the current user login / pass that runs the container, it will allow anybody to own the files
read / written by the fpm daemon (started by www-data).

Another variable will activate / deactivate development modules: `ENVIRONMENT`.
Set to `dev` it'll activate xhprof and xdebug as well as changing `max_execution_time` to `-1` and `display_errors`
to `On`. Set to something else (Example: `production`) it'll do the opposite.

## Custom php.ini directives
If you need to alter the php configuration, you can mount a volume containing `.conf` files to
 `/etc/php5/fpm/user-conf.d/` for PHP 5.x or `/etc/php/7.x/fpm/user-conf.d/` for PHP 7.x

Example:
```yaml
volumes:
    - ./conf/php-fpm-override:/etc/php5/fpm/user-conf.d
```

If you have a file named `conf/php-fpm-override/memory.conf` containing :
```conf
php_value[memory_limit] = 127M
```

The memory limit will be set to 127Mb. Be careful that you need to stop then start your container to make
sure the parameters are taken into account.

## PHP version
To use a specific PHP version, append the version number to the image name.

Eg: `image: edyan/php:5.6`

The following PHP versions are available:

* PHP 7.2 (stretch slim + sury packages)
* PHP 7.1 (stretch slim + sury packages)
* PHP 7.0 (stretch slim)
* PHP 5.6 (jessie slim)
* PHP 5.5 (wheezy slim)
* PHP 5.4 (wheezy slim)
* PHP 5.3 (squeeze stable)


## Specific versions
### edyan/5.6-git
That's exactly the same container than the 5.6 + `git` and `openssh-client` installed.
Useful for Continuous integration with Gitlab.


### edyan/5.6-libreoffice
That's exactly the same container than the 5.6 + the packages git and libreoffice 5 installed.
We use it for internal purpose, when we need to test tools with libreoffice (Generate PDF for instance)
